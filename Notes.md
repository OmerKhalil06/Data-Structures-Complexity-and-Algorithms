# Matrices & List Comprehension
---
## Theory 

### What is a Matrix 
* We can create data structures with values in rows and columns (similar to a table)
  - this can be done by creating a list within a list 
* External libraries: There are external libraries and modules that can imported to help your program process 

Matrix example

```
matrix_A = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,6,7,8]
  ]
  
```
